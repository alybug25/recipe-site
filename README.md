# recipe-site

To see the final project, please follow this link: https://alyssa-cooks.netlify.app/

I built this website as part of Hack Club's Summer of Making event. It was also a chance to practise HTML and CSS skills, as well as building a space to showcase my favourite recipes.
This project was originally inspired by John Smilga's tutorial on Free Code Camp, but I diverted from the tutorial to add my own twists. Admittedly, there is limited functionality in my website for now and there are many areas to improve like using more efficient way to write each individual recipe rather than making a new HTML page each time (very repetitive). However, I am happy with the basic structure of my project so far!
