                <p> I'm a Computer Science student who loves to cook and bake in her free time - especially my mom's recipes.
                    I built this website to practise using HTML/CSS and to create a digital space where I could share all my favourite recipes!
                </p>
                <p> We're based in the UK, but both of my parents are from the Philippines. 
                    Growing up in a Filipino household means my tastebuds have developed a little bias towards Asian dishes but
                    despite this, I do enjoy flavours from all over the world and am very happy to try new ones!
                </p>
                <p> Aside from cooking and baking, I also love to watch cartoons, play music on my guitar, do karaoke (it's in my genes!!), crochet
                    , and try various other arts and crafts. Recently, I've tried my hand at jewellery-making using metal wire, beads, and sea glass.

                <p> Some fun facts about me!</p>
                <ul> 
                    <li>My favourite shows are Steven Universe, Arcane, My Little Pony, The Owl House (okay, well, the list is actually longer than I thought so I'll just stop here)</li>
                    <li>My favourite food is Sinigang (and my favourite vegetable is okra)</li>
                    <li>My favourite song at the moment is Love Like You from Steven Universe</li>
                </ul>
                <p> P.S. blame my belligerent sweet tooth for majority of these recipes being dessert-y</p>
